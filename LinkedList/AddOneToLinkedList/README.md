# Add 1 to a number represented as linked list

**Question** : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-1-to-a-number-represented-as-linked-list/1

A number N is represented in Linked List such that each digit corresponds to a node in linked list. You need to add 1 to it.

Example 1:

Input:


LinkedList: 9->9->9

Output: 1000

Explanation: 9->9->9 represents 999 and when 1 is added it becomes 1000. 

Example 2:

Input:


LinkedList: 4->5->6

Output: 457

Explanation: 4->5->6 represents 456 and when 1 is added it becomes 457. 

Your Task:

Your task is to complete the function addOne() which takes the head of the linked list as the only argument and returns the head of the modified linked list. The driver code prints the number.

**Expected Time Complexity: O(N)**

**Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)**
